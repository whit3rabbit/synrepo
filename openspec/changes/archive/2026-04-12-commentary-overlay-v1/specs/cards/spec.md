## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Distinguish graph-backed and overlay-backed card fields
synrepo SHALL label card fields by source store and freshness so agents can distinguish current structural facts from optional commentary. The `overlay_commentary` field on `SymbolCard` SHALL carry one of five freshness states: `fresh` (commentary matches current source), `stale` (source has changed since generation), `invalid` (entry is present but missing required provenance), `missing` (no entry exists), or `unsupported` (commentary is not defined for this node kind). At `tiny` and `normal` budget tiers, the `overlay_commentary` field is omitted and the response MAY include a `commentary_state: "budget_withheld"` label so callers can distinguish budget-withheld from absent. At `deep` budget, the field is populated if an entry exists; otherwise the state label reflects the actual absence reason.

#### Scenario: Attach commentary to a card
- **WHEN** a card includes both structural data and optional commentary
- **THEN** graph-backed fields remain identifiable as canonical
- **AND** overlay-backed fields are labeled with freshness state rather than presented as equivalent truth

#### Scenario: Return commentary state at tight budget
- **WHEN** a `SymbolCard` is requested at `tiny` or `normal` budget
- **THEN** `overlay_commentary` is omitted from the response
- **AND** the response includes `commentary_state: "budget_withheld"` so callers can distinguish this from an absent entry

#### Scenario: Return fresh commentary at deep budget
- **WHEN** a `SymbolCard` is requested at `deep` budget and a fresh commentary entry exists
- **THEN** `overlay_commentary` is populated with the commentary text and `freshness: "fresh"`
- **AND** the structural fields are not modified or reordered to accommodate the commentary

#### Scenario: Return stale commentary at deep budget
- **WHEN** a `SymbolCard` is requested at `deep` budget and a stale commentary entry exists
- **THEN** `overlay_commentary` is populated with the commentary text and `freshness: "stale"`
- **AND** the staleness label is surfaced to callers rather than withheld

#### Scenario: Return missing state when no commentary exists
- **WHEN** a `SymbolCard` is requested at `deep` budget and no commentary entry exists for the node
- **THEN** `overlay_commentary` is `null` and `commentary_state` is `"missing"`
- **AND** the absence is labeled explicitly; no empty or placeholder commentary is generated

#### Scenario: Return unsupported state for node kinds without commentary
- **WHEN** a `SymbolCard` is requested at `deep` budget for a node kind that the commentary pipeline does not support
- **THEN** `overlay_commentary` is `null` and `commentary_state` is `"unsupported"`
